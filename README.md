This repo includes some notebooks with visualization of performance XRSDKIT models.


If you are getting the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?", when viewing an *.ipynb on a GitHub blob page, you can try to use nbviewer online:

open https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and paste the link to your notebook in the search window (for example, https://github.com/slaclab/figures_for_XRSDKIT/blob/master/Plots_for_regresson_models-All_data.ipynb)
